    <p>Hey Dida! First of all, a very Happy birthday to you. I hope you are enjoying your day. Today is a very special day and I regret not being with you. The picture above is a reminder of the lovely times when we enjoyed together, laughing and having fun. I miss having you around. You are the best Dida ever! Thank you so much for all that you have done for me.  </p>
